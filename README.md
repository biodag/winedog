# winedog

A while back I started this, now I'm working on it again

# Requirements

  - gcc
  - grub (I use grub-mkrescue instead of grub2-mkrescue because i'm too lazy to get it to work)
  - make
  - nasm
  - xorriso

# Building

`make` will build this 
`make clean` will clean up all of the .o files
